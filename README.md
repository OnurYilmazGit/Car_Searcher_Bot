# CarAlarmBot

Buying a car is an investment that should be done thoughtfully. But how do you find a good offer when you are competing with other buyers and car dealers who may have more experience and time than you? Based on this problem, I developed a telegram bot that sends a message to the person about the most suitable vehicles in the car market. Thus, the person can see information about the vehicle such as mileage, price, model, vehicle link as a message without having to search for a vehicle for hours on web pages.
